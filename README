The purpose of the provisional-lts6 overlay is to provide a place
for portage ebuilds that support the lts6 (Long Term Stable 6.x)
overlay, but for various reasons are not suitable for the lts6
overlay.

Typically, these ebuilds provide workaround solutions for problems
that will need to be sorted out eventually.
